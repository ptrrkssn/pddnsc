pddnsc

A perl script to perform smart GSS-TSIG-authentiated RFC2136-compliant
DDNS updates from Unix clients, for example triggered by DHCP updates.
It will try to update IPv4 & IPv6 forward and reverse DNS pointers.

System Requirements:
  1. perl (with Net::IP & Net::DNS)
  2. nsupdate from BIND
  3. A Kerberos (AD) joined Unix client
  4. Optionally: dhclient or NetworkManager DHCP clients
  5. Linux. Probably also on FreeBSD (edit path to perl) & Solaris.


Usage:

1. Put the "pddnsc" script into /sbin

2. Create a script to be called from the DHCP client:

  NetworkManager:
    Create a script '90-ddns-update' in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d:

  dhclient:
    Create a script 'ddns-update' in /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d:

  The script:
    #!/bin/sh
    exec /sbin/pddnsc "$@"


You can also call the script manually to force an update:

  /sbin/pddnsc -v -d -T 1w


If you wish to see the generated DNS updates without actually performing
them, use:

  /sbin/pddnsc -nvdf

(possibly with "-K-" if running as non-root (disables GSS-TSIG/TSIG))


Use "-h" for more help/usage information.
